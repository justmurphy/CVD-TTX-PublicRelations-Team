# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) Table Top Exercise (TTX)

## Objective: 
Simulate the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process and test collaboration, communication, and decision-making skills while addressing a mock scenario of handling a critical vulnerability aligning with the [CERT Guide to CVD](https://certcc.github.io/CERT-Guide-to-CVD/).

## Scenario Overview: 
A security researcher discovers a critical remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used software library, "<clever-name-vuln-lib>", which is very broadly used in a variety of consumer and enterprise services, websites, cloud platforms, and applications—as well as in operational technology (OT) products—to log security and performance information. An unauthenticated remote actor could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system. Teams must respond, coordinate, and manage the disclosure process effectively while minimizing risks to stakeholders.
The Reporter/Finder Team reports the vulnerability to the Coordinator Team who engages with the Vendor Team and other stakeholders. The teams must collaborate to analyze, remediate, and disclose the vulnerability while minimizing risk.

## Method of Facilitation: 
GitHub will be used as the primary platform to facilitate the tabletop exercise, providing participants with centralized access to all necessary documentation and templates required to complete each phase of the exercise. The repository will include detailed instructions, background materials, and structured templates to guide teams through the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. The repository Issues Tracker for each Role/Team will simulate real-world communication scenarios, enabling interaction between different teams, and reflecting the types of coordination and information exchange commonly encountered in actual vulnerability management workflows.
